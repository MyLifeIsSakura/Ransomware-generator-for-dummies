# Chaos-Ransomware-generator

A very simple ransomware generator that generates not so simple ransomware

(contains chaos in name cuz Chaos Cipher was a  past private project of mine)

The ransomware generated will use a advanced encryption algorithm, but it might overwrite files, you can toggle it to be AES and you would get the .exe ransomware file and the decryption .exe file, you can edit the README.txt file to add your bitcoin address or email address, then you can keep the decryption file to only give after paying.

Fun Fact: uses tweaked algorithm of WannaCry/WannaCrypt0r so dont use maliciuosly
